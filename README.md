# MyPortfolio Theme

"MyPortfolio Theme" is a portfolio for developers or creatives to showcase their projects.
It is based on the [HUGO "Creative" Theme](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-creative-theme) by [digitalcraftsman](//github.com/digitalcraftsman), itself based on the [original Bootstrap theme](//github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-creative) by [David Miller](//github.com/davidtmiller).

Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are:
- Responsive portfolio grid with hover effects.
- Possibility to have more than one content sections.
- Dynamic generation of pages based on data content.
- Customisable CSS to override default values (such as main theme colours, fonts, etc.).
- ...
