TODO - CODE:

    - [ ] Make better footer
    - [ ] Check/clean the entire code ...
    - [ ] Make sure page 404 is loaded when 404 error
    - [ ] Add attribute "rel=nofollow" for "a" elements pointing to companies?
        (Might actually be better to keep ref)
    - [ ] CDN: use font awesome (& jquery, Bootstrap,  etc) from online resource AND from local files (fallback).
        => BOTH (look at: https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/using-a-fallback-code-in-case-bootstraps-cdn-is-down/160753/11 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26192897/should-i-use-bootstrap-from-cdn-or-make-a-copy-on-my-server )

        => Replace variables by their value (better perf)
        (create a separate git repo/project for the converter)
    - [ ] Make better CSS?
        => Use "em" & "rem" instead of px, etc.
    - [ ] TAGS: Allow to specify parameter to sort list (eg on number of occurrences).

    LATER:
    - [ ] See about image for brand (and possibility to have text instead).
    - [ ] See for additional text at right of brand.    

- [ ] "HOME" section:
    - [ ] Seems to have a bug with the background in CREATIVE theme: image sometimes not covering the entire screen.

        => Need to adapt the layout as in AIRSPACE theme, "Contact" form.
    - [ ] Add a link to "TIMELINE" page (once page ceated).
        => Look at "NEWSPRINT" theme, "The Library" section for timeline example.

            - Similar to "PROJECTS_<SUBSECTION_TYPE>" page.
            - Without position/role block.
            - With a search possibility (could display all the tags).

                - [ ] Enhance by adding "offsets" & "xl" (& "xs", "sm"?)

                        .Scratch.Set "col-offsets" "col-xl-offset-1"
